Write Your Own Abbreviation
---------------------------
    Use Command Abbr
    Usage: Abbr [name] [code]
    Example:
    Abbr for for (/*TODO*/; /*TODO*/; /*TODO*/) {<CR>/*TODO*/<CR>}<CR>/*TODO*/
    Abbr #ii #include "/*TODO*/"<CR>

    Abbreviate format is same as vim abbr. see help :abbr
    but AdvAbbr has looser limition on name, it support any character as name except space.
    eg: f.f is invalid name in vim abbr but valid in Advancer Abbreviation.
    
    TODO has four different formats
    /*TODO*/, #TODO#, 'TODO', <!--TODO-->
    choose them according to which language is using. 
    for example, /*TODO*/ use for c, cpp, 'TODO' use for ruby
